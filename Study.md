5. install eslint and configuration

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/eslint-config

a. yarn add --dev eslint prettier @react-native-community/eslint-config
or npm install eslint prettier @react-native-community/eslint-config -D
then,maybe you should add a new file named .eslintrc,the directory should be same as node_modules
b. Add to your eslint config (.eslintrc, or eslintConfig field in package.json):

{
"extends": "@react-native-community",
"rules":{
"quotes":[2,"double",{"avoidEscape":true}]
}
}
c. go to package.json, add "lint":"eslint . --ext .js" to scripts section. this means ask eslint check all js file, we could use npm run lint to run this command.
If there are too many formate issues, use yarn lint --fix to formate, then a lot of error will be eliminated

    11 use Flow to do static check

    https://medium.com/@pppped/extend-create-react-app-with-airbnbs-eslint-config-prettier-flow-and-react-testing-library-96627e9a9672
    Once you are ready, install Flow running:
    npm install --save flow-bin
    then install : yarn flow-typed install, this will install types, or flow will complain couldn't resolve moudle
    And add its config file .flowconfig in the project root:
    [ignore]
    <PROJECT_ROOT>/node_modules/.\*
    [include]
    [libs]
    [lints]
    [options]
    [strict]
    Extend your lint script in package.json to include Flow:
    "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "lint": "eslint . && flow"
    },
    Notiece, if add flow after "lint", lint --fix will not work, I recommand add a new line "check":"eslint . && flow", then use this one to check whole syntax.
    Now you can start using Flow adding // @flow on top of any files you want to type check.
    To learn more about Flow and Flow Typed, check out the official docs:
    https://flow.org/
    https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed

https://medium.com/@sgroff04/configure-eslint-prettier-and-flow-in-vs-code-for-react-development-c9d95db07213

13 Error about:can only be used in TypeScript
go to preference-setting, search "javascript.validate.enable", untick it

14 Error about:Cannot resolve module `react-native`.

Solutions:
Create a folder called type-def-libs in your project root and inside create a file called react-native.js with these contents

declare module 'react-native' {
declare module.exports: any
}
Then in your .flowconfig add that folder under libs:

[libs]
./type-def-libs

PS: if other package doesn't recognized by flow (like react-native-paper), just add declare it in the same js file

15 Error: keep reporting "delete cr"

add follow rule to .eslintrc file
"rules": {
"prettier/prettier": ["error",{

]

    **add new virtual device
